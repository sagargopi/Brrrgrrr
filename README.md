# Getting Started with Create React App
## Available Commands
Within your project directory, you can use the following scripts:

## npm start
Starts the app in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to see it in your web browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make any changes.
You might also notice linting errors in the console.

## npm test
Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.
Refer to the section on running tests for additional details.

## npm run build
Compiles the app for production and saves it in the build directory.
It optimizes the React app for production, ensuring it's minified and filenames include hashes for caching purposes.

The production build is ready for deployment!
For more info on deployment, check out the deployment guide.

## npm run eject
If you want to customize the build tool and configuration, you can use the eject command. It will move all configuration files and dependencies (like webpack, Babel, and ESLint) directly into your project folder, giving you full control over them.

Be aware, this action is irreversible! After ejecting, all other commands (except eject) will still work, but they will now refer to the copied files that you can modify as needed. This command is meant for advanced users.
